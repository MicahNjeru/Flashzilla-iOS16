# Flashzilla iOS 16
## About this app
- User's will be shown a car with a prompt which teaches them about something
- It's almost like real-life flash cards used to prepare for examinations

## What I learned
How to:
1. Design an app that supports landscape orientation only 
2. Add accessibility features
3. Fix bugs
